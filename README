1. 
   Following tools Should be install in your system:
     - verilator
     - gtkwave
     - ccache

   installing these softwares are easy.

   To use these tools, you need to set the environment variables - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH if needed.(If you have changed the installation path)


   For bash, 
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...


   For bash,
     export PATH=...

2. Building/Running the code
   a) Following are the commands to build and run the code
   make		// build code
   make run	// run code (it will create trace.vcd)

   The result of running the code will be a 'trace.vcd' waveform file. You can view it using gtkwave (see instructions below).

   b) To change the program binary which you are decoding
   - Edit the following line in Makefile
     RUNELF=$(PWD)/prog2

3. Viewing the trace.vcd waveform
   You can view waveforms using the following command:
     gtkwave trace.vcd
     (If you want to run gtkwave in a server somewhere you should use ssh -X).
